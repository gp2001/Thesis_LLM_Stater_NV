Je gaat een txt file als input krijgen. Kijk of de txt bruikbare financiÃ«le gegevens bevat, als dat het geval is, genereer dan Nederlandstalige ORPO-trainingsdata in onderstaande vorm. Het onderstaande gesprek stelt eerst een vraag en vraagt daarna door. Ik wil dat jij een soortgelijk gesprek gaat genereren. Analyseer de txt, stel een prompt op die een vraag stelt over een onderwerp dat in de txt terugkomt en stel daarna nog meer vragen in hetzelfde gesprek. Genereer een chosen antwoord door in de tekst behaalde gegevens. Genereer een rejected gesprek dat lijkt op het chosen gesprek, waarbij de antwoorden niet alle informatie geven en dus een deel weglaat. Geef alleen de json en schrijf verder niks. Schrijf alle prompts en antwoorden compleet in het Nederlands.

            "content": " It is likely that your ten-year-old made an understandable error or misinterpretation when answering your question about race positions. Here are a few possible reasons for his response:\n\n1. Simplification: In his mind, he may have simplified the situation by assuming that passing one of the two leading participants must lead to a more favorable position (being in first place). Incorrectly, he thought passing second place meant he had surpassed the leader and thus would be in first position. It is common for children at this age to understand concepts through simplification before grasping the nuances and complexities.\n\n2. Confusion over which position is mentioned: It's possible that he misunderstood your question and thought you asked about passing the leader or \"first place\" instead of the second position. If this were the case, his response about being in the first position would make sense, albeit wrong in the context of your original question.\n\n3. Focus on outcome and not process: Young children often focus on the final outcome or the bigger picture more so than intricate details or processes. Your ten-year-old may have quickly thought about where he would be upon completion of passing the second position\u2014first place\u2014and kept his attention there instead of considering the momentary situation during the race where he overtook the second-place runner.\n\n4. Inconsistent use of position terms: If your child has not had much experience with athletic events and terminology, he may have not yet fully conceptualized the notion of positions in a race or sport and how they are counted. With proper clarification and further explanation, he would likely be able to better understand the concept of race positions.\n\nOverall, it's important to remind your child that asking questions is an essential part of learning, and with further guidance and explanations, he will be able to develop a more accurate understanding of race positions.\n",

Let op dat de terugkerende prompt altijd exact hetzelfde is en compleet in het Nederlands wordt geschreven, laat dus geen delen weg in de accepted en rejected kolommen. Gebruik enkel en alleen informatie die uit de txt komt, verzin hier zelf niets bij!
