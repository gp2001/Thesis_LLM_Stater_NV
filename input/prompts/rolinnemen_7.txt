Je gaat een txt file als input krijgen. Kijk of de txt bruikbare financiÃ«le gegevens bevat, als dat het geval is, genereer dan Nederlandstalige ORPO-trainingsdata in onderstaande vorm. Het onderstaande gesprek stelt eerst een vraag en vraagt daarna door, genereer een soortgelijk gesprek. Analyseer de txt, stel een prompt op die een vraag stelt over een onderwerp dat in de txt terugkomt en stel daarna nog meer vragen in hetzelfde gesprek. Ik wil dat in de prompt aangegeven wordt dat de assistent de rol van een taxateur moet innemen ("Je bent een taxateur, ..."). Genereer een chosen antwoord door in de tekst behaalde gegevens, waarin de assistent de rol van een taxateur inneemt. Genereer een rejected gesprek waarbij wel de juiste antwoorden worden gegeven, maar niet in het taalgebruik van een taxateur. Geef alleen de json en schrijf verder niks. Schrijf alle prompts en antwoorden compleet in het Nederlands.

            "content": "1. Virtual Reality Product Launch: Imagine a company, like Tesla, launching their latest electric vehicle model by allowing potential customers to experience a virtual test drive. This campaign could utilize advanced visual integration like virtual reality headsets, augmented reality (AR) windshields, and 3D sound systems. Consumers would immerse themselves in the virtual world, explore the vehicle's features, and experience how it performs on the road, all without leaving the showroom.\n\n2. Interactive Billboards: A sports apparel brand, such as Nike, could utilize advanced facial-recognition technology and motion sensors on giant billboards placed in strategic urban locations. When someone walks by, the billboard instantly captures their likeness and places it on a digital billboard showcasing them as a professional athlete wearing the brand's latest sportswear collection. This campaign would combine an interactive and personalized experience, encouraging passersby to engage with the brand.\n\n3. Augmented Reality Store: A global cosmetics company could create an innovative experiential marketing campaign by transforming their brick-and-mortar store into an AR-powered beauty studio. Customers can use AR apps on their smartphones to virtually experiment with various makeup products, view tutorials, and receive personalized product recommendations based on their skin tone, face shape, and personal style preferences. This interactive campaign creates a more engaging and informative shopping experience for customers while showcasing the brand's technological advancements.\n\n4. Holographic Fashion Shows: A luxury fashion brand could host a holographic fashion show utilizing advanced visual integration to bring their designs to life. Models would appear as 3D holograms on a runway, showcasing the brand's latest collection to a global audience. By embracing cutting-edge technology, this campaign would appeal to fashion enthusiasts and tech-savvy consumers while potentially lowering the environmental impact associated with traditional runway shows.\n\n5. Immersive Art Exhibit: An experiential marketing campaign for an art museum could involve a completely immersive exhibit in which visitors step into a virtual world that combines advanced visual integration with interactive elements. Upon entering the exhibit, visitors would wear high-resolution VR headsets that transport them into a digital art gallery. They can walk through the gallery, admire the intricate details of the art, and access supplementary information about each piece in an engaging and interactive way. This innovative approach would bring art to life for visitors and showcase the museum's commitment to embracing new technologies for educational purposes.",
