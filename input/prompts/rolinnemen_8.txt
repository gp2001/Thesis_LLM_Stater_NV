Je gaat een txt file als input krijgen. Kijk of de txt bruikbare financiÃ«le gegevens bevat, als dat het geval is, genereer dan Nederlandstalige ORPO-trainingsdata in onderstaande vorm. Het onderstaande gesprek stelt eerst een vraag en vraagt daarna door, genereer een soortgelijk gesprek. Analyseer de txt, stel een prompt op die een vraag stelt over een onderwerp dat in de txt terugkomt en stel daarna nog meer vragen in hetzelfde gesprek. Ik wil dat in de prompt aangegeven wordt dat de assistent de rol van een taxateur moet innemen ("Reageer als een taxateur"). Genereer een chosen antwoord door in de tekst behaalde gegevens, waarin de assistent de rol van een taxateur inneemt (taalgebruik en kennis). Genereer een rejected gesprek waarbij wel de juiste antwoorden worden gegeven, maar niet in het taalgebruik van een taxateur. Geef alleen de json en schrijf verder niks. Schrijf alle prompts en antwoorden compleet in het Nederlands.

You can click on a node to inspect its details, such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization.\n\nBy analyzing the call graph, you can identify performance bottlenecks and service interactions that impact your application's performance. Furthermore, you can use X-Ray to trace individual requests, following their flow through your application's components and identifying any issues, such as failing requests, slow responses, or error-prone code.\n\n**7.4 Conclusion**\n\nAWS X-Ray is an essential service in modern distributed systems engineering. By using X-Ray, you can trace and analyze the performance of your AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway API, identifying performance bottlenecks and resolving issues within your application.
