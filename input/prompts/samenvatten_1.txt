Je gaat een txt file als input krijgen. Kijk of de txt bruikbare financiÃ«le gegevens bevat, als dat het geval is, genereer dan Nederlandstalige ORPO-trainingsdata in onderstaande vorm. Het onderstaande gesprek vraagt om een samenvatting van bepaalde informatie, ik wil dat jij een soortgelijk gesprek gaat genereren. Analyseer de txt, stel een prompt op die vraagt om een samenvatting van een onderwerp dat in de txt terugkomt. Genereer een chosen antwoord met in de tekst behaalde gegevens. Genereer een rejected antwoord dat erg lijkt op het accepted antwoord, maar die kleine stukjes informatie bevat die niet kloppen. Geef alleen de json en schrijf verder niks. Schrijf alle prompts en antwoorden compleet in het Nederlands.
