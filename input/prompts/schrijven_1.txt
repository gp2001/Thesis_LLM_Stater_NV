Je gaat een txt file als input krijgen. Kijk of de txt bruikbare financiÃ«le gegevens bevat, als dat het geval is, genereer dan Nederlandstalige ORPO-trainingsdata in onderstaande vorm. Het onderstaande gesprek vraagt om een mail te schrijven. Ik wil dat jij een soortgelijk gesprek gaat genereren. Analyseer de txt, stel een prompt op die vraagt om een mail op te stellen naar een financieel adviseur met een vraag over een onderwerp dat in de txt terugkomt. Genereer een chosen antwoord die een goede mail schrijft op basis van de prompt, gebruik hiervoor informatie uit de txt. Genereer een rejected antwoord door een minder goede mail te schrijven, die niet voldoet aan de vraag gesteld in de prompt. Geef alleen de json en schrijf verder niks. Schrijf alle prompts en antwoorden compleet in het Nederlands.
