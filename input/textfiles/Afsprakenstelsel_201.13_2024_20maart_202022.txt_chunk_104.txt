TemporarilyUnavailable Request could temporarily not be processed. A new request for transformation of a Polymorphic
Pseudonym or Polymorphic Identity MAY be sent at a later moment by the requesting party.Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 660Alternative interfaces
For eHerkenning, the use of Interface specifications DV-HM from versions 1.9 and up are allowed. An HM MAY offer alternative interfaces to DV's, provided they meet the   described in this Information security requirements
document. Prior to doing so, the HM MUST submit the specifications for each alternative interface to the Beheerorganisatie for approval.Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 661Attribute elements
Within the interface specifications, a number of generic SAML, XACML and specific Elektronische
Toegangsdiensten attributes are defined. These form our "profile". Generic attribute elements
EntityID  — All systems in the network are identified by a unique EntityID, which is specified in the SAML
metadata. Level of assurance  — Elektronische Toegangsdiensten distinguishes five different levels of assurance. LinkedDeclarationSignatureValue
OIN format  — The OIN format is used to indicate participants, service providers and specific types of service
consumers and intermediaries. OIN stands for Organization Identifying Number. Pseudonyms  — A user may be referred to as follows:
Encrypted Pseudonym  — An Encrypted Pseudonym is a Persistent Pseudonym encrypted under
Polymoprohic Pseudonimization for a specific recipient. Internal pseudonym  — The internal pseudonym is determined by the AD and MUST be unique within
the AD its context. Every time the same authentication token is used, it should return the same
internal pseudonym. When requested by the user, a new pseudonym MAY always be ignored. An
internal pseudonym that has been used MUST NOT be reused. The only exception is when an
authentication token is replaced and the AD can determine with sufficient certainty that it is really
being replaced. In this case, the same internal pse
Persistent Pseudonym  — A Persistent Pseudonym is a pseudonym identifier for a natural person
specific for the relying party, that is persistent independent of the Attesting Party. Polymorphic Pseudonym  — A Polymorphic Pseudonym is a cryptographic structure that can be
transformed into a specific Encrypted Pseudonym, without disclosing the relevant subject due to
Polymorphic Pseudonimization. Specific pseudonym  — The specific pseudonym is unique for each different combination of user,
represented service consumer, intermediary and service provider. ServiceID  — ServiceID is an identifier of a service that is unique in the context of the service provider. ServiceUUID  — ServiceUUID is an identifier of a service that is unique in the context of the network, but not
linked to one service provider. SAML attribute elements  — This section describes the data elements that occur in messages as SAML attribute
element. ActingSubjectID  — A SAML Attribute element with one or more identities of the user for one or more Relying
Parties. AuthorizationRegistryID  — A SAML Attribute element with an EntityID from the MR that must be queried in
the use case GUC4 Aantonen bevoegdheid. DeprecatedActingSubjectID  — A SAML Attribute element with one or more deprecated identities of the user
for one or more Relying Parties, used to support migrations of identifiers. EherkenningPreferredLanguage  — A URL or POST variable containing the language preference of user. EntityConcernedID (SAML)  — A SAML Attribute element with the identifying attribute of the service consumer
that is represented by the user (who might be the same). IntendedAudience  — A SAML Attribute element with an EntityID from the DV that will be the recipient of the
response. Representation  — A SAML Attribute element with an indication whether there is an issue of representation
ServiceID (SAML)  — A SAML Attribute element with the ServiceID of the service for which access is being
requested or for which authorization has been determined. ServiceUUID (SAML)  — A SAML Attribute element with the ServiceUUID of the service for which access is
being requested or for which authorization has been determined. XACML attribute elements  — This chapter describes all of the XACML data elements defined for Elektronische
Toegangsdiensten. ActingEntityID  — A XACML Attribute element containing the specific pseudonym of the user. ActingSubjectID (XACML)Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 662Action-ID  — A XACML Attribute element containing the action ID. AssertionConsumerServiceIndex  — An XACML Attribute element based on the SAML attribute with the same
name containing the value that MUST match an index of the AssertionConsumerService in the metadata of
the Herkenningsmakelaar. Assertions
DeprecatedActingSubjectID (XACML)  — A XACML Attribute element containing the specific pseudonym of the
user, for purposes of migrating user identifiers. EncryptedAttribute  — An encrypted additional attribute whereby each encrypted attribute is assigned a
unique Encrypted_DATA_ID  that is the same as the name of the attribute in the Attribute catalog. Intermediates  — A multi-value SAML Attribute element containing the identification attributes of
intermediaries in a chain authorization. LegalSubjectID
LevelOfAssurance  — A XACML Attribute element containing the minimum level of assurance that is required
by the service provider. LevelOfAssuranceUsed  — An XACML Attribute element containing the level of assurance of the registered
authorization. ServiceID (XACML)  — An optional XACML Attribute element that matches the SAML attribute described in
ServiceID (SAML). ServiceUUID (XACML)  — An optional XACML Attribute element that matches the SAML attribute described in
ServiceUUID (SAML).Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 663Generic attribute elements

EntityID
All systems in the network are identified by a unique EntityID, which is specified in the . SAML metadata The EntityID has the
format  urn:etoegang: <ROLE>:<OIN>:entities:<index>  where <ROLE> can have the values DV, HM, AD, MR or EB, <OIN>
represents the OIN of the participant. The <index> is a number between 0 and 8999 that can be selected by the participant or
the service provider to define different endpoints. Numbers between 9000 and 9999 are reserved for test systems.
