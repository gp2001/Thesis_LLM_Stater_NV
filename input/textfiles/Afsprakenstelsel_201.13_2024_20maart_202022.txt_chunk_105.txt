When changes are made to the participant's system (e.g. when moving to a new version of Elektronische Toegangsdiensten)
the participant MAY change a system's EntityID. Although they look similar, EntityID's are not to be confused with 's. There is an n:n relationship between ServiceID
EntityID's and ServiceID's. One system may offer more than one service, or the other way around: more systems can offer the
same service.Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 665

The AD MUST communicate the Level of Assurance at which the authentication was realized. This realization is the
and the Level of Assurance of minimum of the Level of Assurance of the registration process of the authenticated user
the authentication mechanism applied. An AD MUST NOT communicate a level for which it is not certified. The MR MUST communicate the Level of Assurance of the . A MR MUST NOT communicate a registered authorization

Level of Assurance of all applicable service authorizations chosen by the user. The HM MUST communicate the effective Level of Assurance of the combined assertions. The effective Level of
assurance is the minimum of the LoA of the Authentication assertion and (if applicable) the LoA of the
Representation authorization assertion(s). The MR communicates two Levels of Assurance in its Assertion. A LevelOfAssurance (requested) and a
LevelOfAssuranceUsed (actually obtained). The HM MUST use the LevelOfAssuranceUsed from the MR Assertion as the
LoA of the Representation authorization.Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 666LinkedDeclarationSignatureValue
