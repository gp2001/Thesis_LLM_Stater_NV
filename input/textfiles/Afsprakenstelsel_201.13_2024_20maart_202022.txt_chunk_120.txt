Those roles that are
in direct contact with their customers (e.g. a HM with it's DV's and an AD/MR with its users) are allowed to tighten security
based on their risk analysis. All communication between peers in these specifications is based on HTTP. All communication MUST be secured using
Transport Layer Security, TLS. As a result, all communication MUST be transported over HTTPS ( https://tools.ietf.org/html
). /rfc2818Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 745For HTTPS and TLS, any implementation MUST take the recommendations in BCP195 ( ) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525
and the latest version of the NCSC-security guidelines for TLS-usage (currently   https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc
/documenten/publicaties/2021/januari/19/ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-2.1/ICT-
). The following requirements are applicable for this beveiligingsrichtlijnen+voor+Transport+Layer+Security+v2.1.pdf
specification in relation to the NCSC guidelines:
For back-channel communication, the guidelines categorized as "good" MUST be applied. For front-channel communication, the guidelines for "good" MUST be applied and the guidelines for "sufficient"
MAY be applied, depending on target audience and support requirements. Guidelines categorized as "insufficient" MUST NOT be applied and those categorized as "phase out" SHOULD NOT be
used. As HTTP itself is stateless, implementations are free to choose a method of maintaining state or sessions with a User-agent
when applicable. The following applies for any HTTP state/session mechanism:
HTTP servers MUST ensure session and state information is secured and User-agents are properly instructed with
relevant security settings (e.g. proper cookie lifetime, Secure setting for cookies, CORS headers and similar). Any HTTP session or state tracking mechanisms MUST be implemented using current best practices to avoid session
hijacking and other attacks. For more information, see for instance https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries

Multiple certificates
SAML and XML-encryption allow for multiple ‘recipients’ of the same encrypted element. The (SAML) construct for this is
specified in more detail in errata E43 of . SAML 2.0 errata 05
This feature MAY be used to help facilitate a certificate change at the Service Provider, by (temporarily) allowing both the old
and/or the new certificate to be used. The following additional requirements than apply. each EncryptedKey MUST have a CarriedKeyName equal to the KeyName used in the KeyInfo of the EncryptedData.
