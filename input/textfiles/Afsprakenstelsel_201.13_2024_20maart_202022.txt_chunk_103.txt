@DateTime 1 Time of issuing of the request. @RequestID 1 Unique identifier for this request. <Requester> 1 EntityID (OIN) of the requesting MachtigingsRegister. <RelyingParty> 1 EntityID (OIN) of the intended relying party. <RelyingPartyKeySetVersion> 1 Key set version to be used for relying party. <PolymorphicPseudonym> 1 Polymorphic Pseudonymization structure for the user to be transformed to an
encrypted pseudonym or identity. Only one (non-signed) Polymorphic Pseudonym /
Identity MUST be present, depending on the request type. <Role> 0.. 1Optional "persoonsrol". Reserved for future use where the same user can act in
different roles, e.g. private, volunteer and employee. <TransactionID> 0.. 1Optional "transactie ID". Reserved for future use where privacy prohibits use of a
persistent pseudonym. TransactionID can be used to create a transaction-, session- or
case- specific pseudonym. Also for guarantees for the 4-eyes principle, TransactionID
can be used in combination with the default Role (otherwise a person could break a 4-
eyes signature by using two different Roles). Another example is eIDAS that requires a
pseudonym per EU country, for which a countryID can be used als TransactionID to
make the resulting pseudonym specific and persistent per country. Rules for processing a Transformation Request
