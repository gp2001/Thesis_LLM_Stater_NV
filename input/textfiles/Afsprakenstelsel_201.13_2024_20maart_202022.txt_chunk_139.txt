Classifier Description Usage restrictions
PublicDomain The ServiceInstance
is operated by the
Dienstverlener
(Service Provider) to
implement a service
under a
responsibility in the
public domain.The Dienstverlener MUST operate under "Artikel 1:
1 Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht". Although a service in the public domain will
typically request an  or urn:etoegang:1.12
, this is not mandatory. EntityConcernedID:RSIN
Other identifiers may be used by services classified
as PublicDomain as well. Service requesting aforementioned identifiers
typically do operate as a PublicDomain service. In case the ServiceInstance is classified as 'eIDAS-
outbound' as well, the actual DV in another
member state operates under an equivalent
legislation and are requested as such via the eIDAS
interoperability framework (eIDAS: SPType
'public'). eIDAS-
inboundThe service is an
eTD-service that is
receptive to users
from other eIDAS-
member states.Services that want to accept authentication and
authorization through eIDAS MUST be classified
as 'eIDAS-inbound'. Currently the eIDAS-
berichtenservice only accepts messages in the
public domain. Therefore a service must use BOTH
classifiers 'eIDAS-inbound' AND 'PublicDomain'
combined to connect effectively to eIDAS. eIDAS-
outboundThe service is a
proxy for services in
other member
states under the
eIDAS regulation. The eIDAS-berichtenservice has proxy-services
listed in the Service Catalog for services in
other eIDAS-member states that may be accessed
through eIDAS. These proxy services MUST be
classified as 'eIDAS-outbound'. The elements OrganizationDisplayName, ServiceName, ServiceDescription, ServiceDescriptionURL, PurposeStatement,
ServiceURL and PrivacyPolicyURL MAY be included for different languages. Note: At this moment the use of ASTA-sets and Service Intermediarion is limited to the EB for eIDAS Outgoing. Any ServiceProvider interested in ServiceIntermediation or ASTA-sets should contact their HM for the proper procedure. Any changes in ServiceIntermediation elements in the ServiceCatalog will not be propagated automatically.Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 814
Rules for processing Service Catalog
All ServiceUUIDs MUST be both global and temporal unique. The Beheerorganisatie MUST verify all UUIDs that are
used are defined only once. changes to a Service SHOULD result in a new distinct ServiceUUID. Significant
ServiceDefinitions with the same ServiceUUID are exempt from global uniqueness, these are shared services and
MUST be identical (identical but excluding @IsPublic and HerkenningsmakelaarId). Herkenningsmakelaar passes on the ServiceUUID of the ServiceInstance matching the requested combination of
Dienstverlener- AttributeConsumingServiceIndex, or whatever other mechanic used in the bilateral DV-HM
interface, in further authentication and attribute requests. A receiving AD/MR/BSNk inspects the Service Catalogue to determine the exact authorization demands and relying
parties for the requested ServiceInstance based upon the ServiceUUID. The following logic applies:
The ServiceUUID of the referenced ServiceDefinition is always used to determine the mandate/authorization
demands. The requested ServiceInstance always determine the relying entity (or entities) for the authorization request. In case of service intermediation: a service instance references a service instance (rather than a service
definition) via the IntermediatedService element. In case of service intermediation: the service instance pointed to is considered the true relying party; the
requesting party is merely an acceptable attesting entity (only to be included in subjectconfirmation HoK). Participants MUST check the validity of the Service Certificate when using any attributes in the certficate. In case of service intermediation; the approval verification MUST be based on the ServiceIntermediation element
belonging to the referenced service instance. The following rules apply:
@intermediationAllowed Processing rule
noIntermediation Participants MUST NOT allow service intermediation for the Service (default)
generalAvailable Participants MUST allow service intermediation by any dienstverlener listed in the
Service Catalog as service intermediary for the Service
serviceProviderOnly Participants MUST only allow the Service Provider itself to perform service
intermediation ( = ) Dienstbemiddelaar  Dienstaanbieder
requiresApproval Participants MUST allow only those Service Intermediaries that have their OIN listed
under ServiceIntermediationAllowed to perform service intermediation for the Service
Make sure to look at the rule relating to the use of BSN and minimal level of assurance mentioned in
