MRs MAY use this text to help administrators determine the authorizations). ServiceDescriptionURL (a URL of max 512 characters where a detailed description of the service can be
found, determined by the service provider. MRs MAY include this link to help administrators
determine the authorizations). AuthnContextClassRef (assurance level that is required for the service, determined by the service
provider)
HerkenningsmakelaarId (the OIN of the  that provides the service catalog Herkenningsmakelaar (HM)
entry for this service definition)
EntityConcernedTypesAllowed (multivalue entry with the different types of service consumers that are
granted access to the service). In case multiple EntityConcernedTypes are defined, they are assigned to
Identifier sets (for more information on identifier sets, see below). ActingSubjectTypesAllowed (multivalue entry with the different types of acting subjects that are
granted access to the service). In case multiple ActingSubjectTypes are defined, they are assigned to
Identifier sets
Allowed ActingSubjectTypes are:
urn:etoegang:1.12:EntityConcernedID:PseudoID
urn:etoegang:1.12:EntityConcernedID:BSN
urn:etoegang:1.13:EntityConcernedID:Pseudo  (is always included by default and MUST
NOT be specified in the ActingSubjectTypesAllowed identifier set)
If the AD cannot deliver the ASTA, the AD will throw an error, see Interface
specifications HM-AD
EntityConcernedTypesAllowed and ActingSubjectTypesAllowed are split in their own lists and MUST be
processed accordingly. The AD MUST process the ActingSubjectTypesAllowed list AND the  EntityConcernedID:Pseudo
the MR and EB (in case of inbound authentication requests) MUST process
the EntityConcernedTypesAllowed list
Both EntityConcernedTypesAllowed and ActingSubjectTypesAllowed are grouped in separate Identifier
Sets. An identifier set is a cluster of identifier Types with the same set number. Identifier Set  MUST adhere to the following rule:Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 812
Identifiers MAY be used in multiple identifier sets
An SP may request multiple EntityConcernedTypes in an identifier set. The SP may also
indicate to honor restrictions. When an Attribute with a ServiceRestriction is included
in the AttributeStatement, users can access the service under the restrictions as
specified for that type of restriction. Currently, the only restrictions supported are
and   (deprecated). The ServiceRestriction:Vestigingsnr ServiceRestriction:SubdossierNr
ServiceRestriction:Vestigingsnr CAN be indicated in the  , in such case Service catalog
both the ServiceRestriction:Vestigingsnr and ServiceRestriction:SubdossierNr will be
returned, if applicable. Identifier sets either only contain ASTA's or ECTA's
The ASTA's MUST NOT be requested by DV's, ONLY the EB and BRP MAY request ASTA's
ServiceRestrictionsAllowed (multivalue entry with the different types of service restrictions the service
provider can honor). RequestedAttribute (multivalue entry with all the attributes that may be requested for this service)
PurposeStatement (a statement by the service provider why this attribute is requested, 1024
characters). isRequired: For each requested attribute that is included, the service provider MAY use
isRequired to indicate whether the attribute is required for the DV application to work
properly. If isRequired is not defined, the default value 'false' is implied. Per ServiceInstance:
IsPublic (attribute that indicates whether the service provider is in public)
ServiceID  (an identifier of a service instance that is unique in the context of the service provider)
If the DV provides a , it MUST be specified in the service catalog with a reserved index portal function
number 0. BsnkStructureVersion - Optional: This element is required when the ECTA or ASTA has a BSN or
PseudoID, otherwise it MUST NOT be used. Value must be a valid BsnkStructureVersion (see BSNk
confluence "1" or "2"). If no version is used, or if the BsnkStructureVersion is invalid, version 1 MUST
be used. BsnkRecipientKeySetVersion - Optional: This element is required when the ECTA set or ASTA set
contains a BSN or PseudoID, otherwise it MUST NOT be used. Value must be identical to the RKSV as
noted on the BSNk keys the ServiceProvider is using voor decrypting the BSN or PseudoID. The old way of getting the recipientKeySetVersion (by retrieving this from the most recent certificate)
MUST NOT be used after 1-1-2021. ServiceUUID  (a universally unique identifier to allow identifying and referencing this instance)
InstanceOfService (a reference to a ServiceUUID of a Service definition being implemented. An
InstanceOfService MUST be present).
