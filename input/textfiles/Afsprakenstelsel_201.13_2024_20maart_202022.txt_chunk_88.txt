The eIDAS specifications transfer both in one message, thus separating these in two calls is deemed ineffective. Request
A HM MUST request the EB with an AuthnRequest,  identical to the AuthnRequest of the  . All Interface specifications HM-AD
processing rules MUST be adhered to. Rules for procesing  request
If a request is received for ECTA urn:etoegang:1.12:EntityConcernedID:BSN the EB must check if the Service Provider
is entitiled to receive the BSN by checking if the Service Provider is listed on the  . Autorisatielijst BSN
If the Service Provider is not listed the EB must handle the error as an unrecoverable error (: urn:oasis:names:
tc:SAML:2.0:status:RequestUnsupported.). In case a portal service request is made at the eIDAS-berichtenservice, the HM MUST return a error message
containing ResultMajor "RequesterError" and ResultMinor "NotSupported". Additional processing rules for request
A receiving EB
if the ServiceInstance belonging to the ServiceUUID in the AuthnRequest is NOT classified as 'eIDAS-inbound', MUST
handle this as a non-recoverable error (see  ). Error handling
The EB (in case of inbound authentication requests) MUST process the EntityConcernedTypesAllowed list
Response
The EB MUST construct an Assertion identical to the Assertion of an AD as defined in the . In Interface specifications HM-AD
case an authentication in another eIDAS member state uses representation, the EB MUST construct an Assertion identical to
the Assertion of an MR as defined in the . Interface specifications HM-MR
The EB MUST respond to the AuthnRequest in a single SAML Response message (transferred via Artifact binding), using the
following structure:
@ID 1 SAML: Unique message characteristic. MUST identify the message uniquely within the scope of
the sender and receiver for a period of at least 12 months. @InResponseTo 1 SAML: Unique attribute of the AuthnRequest for which this Response message is the answer. @Version 1 SAML: Version of the SAML protocol. The value MUST be '2.0'. @IssueInstant 1 SAML: Time of issuing of the Response. @Destination 1 SAML: URL of the endpoint of the HM on which the message is offered. MUST match the HM's
metadata. @Consent 0 Elektronische Toegangsdiensten: MUST NOT be present
