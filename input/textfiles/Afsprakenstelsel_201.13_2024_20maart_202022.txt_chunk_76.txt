MUST verify each collected assertion has at minimum the Level of Assurance as requested by the DV. If verification
fails, MUST handle the received responses as an unrecoverable error. MUST provide an <AuthnContextClassRef>:
By default fill the AuthnContextClassRef with the value 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:
unspecified'. When a DV explicitly requests a detailed LoA by including an AuthnContextClassRef in its AuthnRequest
(see above): The HM MUST communicate the effective Level of Assurance of the combined assertions. The
effective Level of assurance is the minimum of the LoA of the Authentication assertion and (if applicable)
the LoA of the Representation authorization assertion(s). The MR communicates two Levels of Assurance in its Assertion. A LevelOfAssurance (requested) and a
LevelOfAssuranceUsed (actually obtained). The HM MUST use the LevelOfAssuranceUsed from the MR
Assertion as the LoA of the Representation authorization. . HM MUST provide an <Subject> with the following <NameID>
IF DV connects to r1.13 (or newer) AND non-represenation THEN copy AD-assertion: Subject.NameID. TransientID
IF DV connects to r1.13 (or newer) AND representation THEN copy MR-assertion: Subject.NameID. TransientID
IF DV connects to r1.11 (or older)   copy MR-assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Subject.ActingEntityID THEN
HM MUST provide an <AttributeStatement> with the following <Attributes> and <EncryptedAttributes>
IF DV connects to r1.13 (or newer)  THEN
the HM must  copy all relevant information (see ) from the below Interface specifications DV-HM
sources to the ActingSubjectID attribute:
MR-Assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Subject.ActingSubjectID (EncryptedID)
AD-assertion: Response.Assertion.AttributeStatement.ActingSubjectID. copy all relevant AD-assertion: AttributeStatement.EncryptedAttribute
IF Representation THEN
IF DV connects to r1.13 (or newer) THEN
copy all relevant EncryptedID from MR-Assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Subject. LegalSubjectID to <LegalSubjectID>
copy all relevant EncryptedID from MR-Assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Subject. ActingSubjectID to <ActingSubjectID>
copy  MR-assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Resource.EncryptedAttribute  all relevant
IF DV connects to r1.11 (or older)  Representation   copy MR-assertion: XACMLAuthz- AND THEN
Decision.Resource.EntityConcernedID
copy MR-Assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Statement.Request.Resource.ServiceID
IF available copy all MR-assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Resource.ServiceRestrictions
IF Ketenmachtiging    copy MR2-Assertion: XACMLAuthz-Decision.Statement.Request. THEN
Resource.IntermediateEntityID
MUST provide an <Advice>, by default filled with verbatim copy of all Assertions – so that original
signatures over the assertions remains verifiable – gathered during the authentication process. HM MAY
offer their DV to omit this information, if they archive this information and allow for later retrieval.Afsprakenstelsel Elektronische Toegangsdiensten | pagina 561
NOTE: When copying encrypted XML elements (<EncryptedID>, <EncryptedAttribute>) to create the summary declaration
the HM MUST substitute used XML identifiers to point at the EncryptedTypes for a guaranteed unique identifier. This MAY
be accomplished by pre- or suffixing the used identifier in the copy. (Rationale:  values must uniquely identify the elements which bear them.
