<ReadableCard > Info 0.. 1String max 60 chars. ReadableCardInfo is text that – combined with the MeansType – has
just enough information for a user to recognise the specific 'collection of
authorizations' in the domain of the MachtigingsRegister. ReadableCardInfo MUST be
unique per user, but  MUST not be usable to identify the user. For privacy reasons this
MUST have a low entropy so that many users have this same ReadableCardInfo
. ReadableCardInfo
For Autorisations a second part has to be added with the date of the last added
Autorisation eg "Last Authorization added at 31-01-2018". Therefor the MR has to register
a new status with every new autorisation. For MachtigingsRegister this element is
required for every registration to have the most actual "Last Autorisation" (any new will
overwrite the old text). <Status> 1 (as long as any authorization in  contain one of the specified statusses: MUST   Activated
this collection is active in the BSN Domain), (if the last active authorization in Suspended
this collection is suspended), (if the last active authorization in this collection is Expired
expired) or  (if the last active authorization in this collection is Revoked). This  Revoked
element is required for every registration to have the most actual status. Any new status
will overwrite the old status. < > RevocationURL 0.. 1String max 1024 chars. RevocationURL is a valid URL which can be used by mijnoverheid
(when providing the user an overview of electronic identification means) to redirect the
user to the MachtigingsRegister for managing this collection of autorisations, for
instance suspending authorizations. For privacy reasons this RevocationURL can have a
random collection-specific unique-ID (not a userid!), but otherwise MUST consist of low
entropy data. The URL could use other elements from this registration request message
(except EncryptedPseudonym). In the Metadata the RoleDescriptor for MachtigingsRegister already has a generic URL to
the MachtigingsRegister authorization management function. That URL will be default
unless a RevocationURL is provided. This RevocationURL could be used to direct the user
directly to the appropriate collection of authorizations. Or a RevocationURL with a
random collection-specific unique-ID could me used to immediately Suspend the
collection for a short period of time , possibly even without authenticating the user. Any new will overwrite the old text and empty string can be used to cancel the (working of
this) RevocationURL. Processing rules for Status Registration Request
A requesting MachtigingsRegister
MUST await a successful response or retry to send the request. .
